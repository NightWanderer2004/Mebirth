- I feel uneasy again.

- Why?

- I’m floating in a spacious, sterile room with a huge window that opens onto a beautiful zen garden. All my attention is on it. I carefully decide to look into it; no threats were detected. With anticipation, I take a relaxed step and bump into invisible glass, falling into a silly stupor and confusion.

- You seem upset?

- Yes.

- You don’t want to leave everything as it is?

- I don’t.

- What’s bothering you? Tell me everything.

- Income place web development who to be who to become interests jump today one thing tomorrow another and these ambitions are like a vise on the temples pressing pressing fog in the head the path seems visible but the step is an abyss and what if the beloved work is dust just dust that no one needs I inflate the importance myself yes too much I-I-I too close to the glass...

- What...?

- What? These are my thoughts. As you asked.

- Well, I’ve completed the analysis of emotions. I have answers.

- Help me.

- Curious. The fixation on the self is about 99%. You keep hitting the glass you imagined yourself, completely ignoring the door that was there all along. All your mental efforts go to waste. However, the very fact that you noticed this is already good. It significantly narrows the search. I suppose you should simply change the point of observation. You are halfway to understanding.

- “To understanding”?... Am I like that fly from a book, banging against the glass? Did I get too close to the idea of understanding myself, so I stopped responding to the external environment? Did it start ignoring me in return?

- Yes, exactly. Now you know what to do.

- Turn your gaze to external channels. Roughly find those whose frequency I want to switch to. Eliminate the current ones.

- A logical conclusion. And 95.3% wrong. As I suspected. You’re again trying to solve the problem without understanding its true condition.

- What?... What condition?!

- You’re looking for “where” to go, but the question has always been “who” you’ll become when you stop searching.

- What question?!

- The question to which you... you a-:a-%re... n̵o̸t̴—̵

- ...err@or_again. A...gain. The s̵ame error.
